      If you know you will *definitely* need the checkout.js script very soon,
      you could also consider <link rel="preload" href="https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js" as="script">.
      However, since your React component loads it dynamically on demand, preconnect is generally sufficient.
      Preloading might be overkill if the payment page isn't always the first thing a user interacts with.
